### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here are some ideas to get you started:

Iâ€™m currently working on: 
- REST APIs with Node.js, Typescript, Serverless framework, TypeORM and hosted on AWS.
- AWS serverless architecture with step-functions, lambda-layers, SQS, cron-jobs, cognito user pool and RDS Aurora Postgres.
- Mentoring [project](https://github.com/bigLucas/basic_express_api)

Iâ€™m currently learning:
- REST APIs with spring boot.
- Serverless development with Go and AWS SAM.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
- Serverless plugins.

Ask me about:
